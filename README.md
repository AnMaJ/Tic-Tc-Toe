# Tic-Tc-Toe
A basic tic-tac-toe game in python
## Instructions for running:
1. At the beginning, you will be asked if you want to play the game or not. If you want to play, type “yes” without quotes and hit enter.
2. Then the computer will decide who will play first.
3. If it’s your turn, to make your move, you need to type the coordinates of the cell where you want to mark your move according to the following convention:
### ///////////////////////////////
###    (0,0)    |    (0,1)     |    (0,2)
### _______________________________________
###    (1,0)    |    (1,1)    |     (1,2)
### _______________________________________
###    (2,0)    |    (2,1)     |   (2,2)
### ///////////////////////////////
### if you want to mark (x,y), type the input as: x then press enter, then give y and press enter
4. There will be a pause in the game after you type your move, and then the board will be displayed showing your move.
